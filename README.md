# Machine Learning Algorithms
Within my studies of Data Science we deal with a variety of commonly used algorithms in the field of Machine Learning. This repository contains the code of my own implementation of those algorithms in Python.

# Algorithms
## Classifier
Classifiers are algorithmic models within the field of supervised machine learning. The aim of Classifiers is to identify the label (also: class) of a new, unknown observation (datapoint) with the highest possible accuracy. There are different classifier algorithms.

List of implemented algorithms:
- KNN (K-nearest-neighbor algorithm)


## Cluster
Clustering algorithms are a subset of unsupervised machine learning. Their goal is to automatically group similar objects into sets. Again, there are different clustering algorithms.

List of implemented algorithms:
- K-Means (K-means algorithm)
